Great! You're aiming for a **controlled GitHub workflow** where:

* 🧪 Devs clone from `develop` to create feature branches.
* 🔄 Features are merged **back into `develop`**.
* 🚀 `release/*` branches are cloned from `main` to prepare a production release.
* 🔃 `develop` is merged into `release/*`.
* ✅ Only `release/*` can merge into `main`.

This pattern is ideal for **stable main, prepped releases**, and **collaborative dev**.

# 🛠️ Final GitHub Workflow (Updated with Cloning Steps)

| Branch      | Purpose                    | Cloned From        | Merge Flow                     | Notes                                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `develop`   | Main dev branch            | `main` (initially) | `feature/*` → `develop`        | Central integration branch              |
| `feature/*` | New feature work           | `develop`          | `feature/*` → `develop` via PR | Each new feature starts here            |
| `release/*` | Prepare production release | `main`             | `develop` → `release/*` via PR | Only select stable changes from develop |
| `main`      | Stable production code     | —                  | `release/*` → `main` via PR    | Always deployable                       |

## 🔁 Step-by-Step Developer Workflow

### 🧑‍💻 Developer creates a feature:

1. **Checkout `develop`**:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. **Create feature branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/login-form
   ```

3. **Make changes, commit, push**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/login-form
   ```

4. **Open PR → `develop`**, get approval, CI passes.

---

### 👨‍🔧 Release Manager Prepares a Release:

1. **Create release branch from `main`**:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b release/v1.2
   git push origin release/v1.2
   ```

2. **Merge `develop` into release**:

   ```bash
   git checkout release/v1.2
   git merge develop
   ```

3. **Open PR → `main`**, after QA, tests, and final review.

## 🔒 Enforcing This with GitHub

### 🔐 Branch Protection Rules

| Branch      | Protection Rules                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main`      | ✅ Require PRs, ✅ CI checks, ✅ Reviews, ✅ Allow only `release/*` as source branch |
| `release/*` | ✅ PRs, ✅ CI, ✅ Only merge from `develop` (enforced by policy/process)            |
| `develop`   | ✅ Require PRs from `feature/*`, ✅ Status checks, ✅ Reviewer approval             |
| `feature/*` | ❌ Not protected (devs work freely here)                                          |

### 🧾 CODEOWNERS File (in `.github/CODEOWNERS`)

```plaintext
# main needs lead approval
/main @release-managers

# release branches need QA or lead approval
/release/* @qa-team @release-managers

# develop needs dev lead review
/develop @dev-leads
```

### 🧪 Optional GitHub Action to Block Direct Merges

A custom GitHub Action can **fail the PR** if `main` is the target and the source is not a `release/*` branch:

```yaml
name: Prevent Unauthorized Merges to Main
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  check-source-branch:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Block if not release branch
        run: |
          if [[ "${{ github.head_ref }}" != release/* ]]; then
            echo "Only release/* branches can merge into main"
            exit 1
          fi
```
