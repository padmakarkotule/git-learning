No problem! Let's walk through the **entire sequence from start to finish**, step-by-step, including everything from **setting up Git** to **generating and configuring SSH keys**, and finally pushing your code to a remote GitHub repository.

This guide will be **comprehensive** for someone new to Git. Weâ€™ll cover:

1. **Installing Git**
2. **Setting up SSH keys**
3. **Creating a GitHub repository**
4. **Connecting your local machine to GitHub via SSH**
5. **Commit and push changes**
6. **Working with branches**

---

### **Step 1: Install Git**

If you haven't already installed Git on your system, here's how you can do it:

1. **Download Git**:
   - Go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

2. **Install Git**:
   - Run the installer and follow the steps in the installation wizard.
   - During the installation, you can leave the default options selected (unless you want to customize).
   - Once installed, **open Git Bash** (on Windows) or your terminal (on Mac/Linux) to run Git commands.

---

### **Step 2: Configure Git**

Before using Git, you need to set your name and email. These details will be associated with your commits.

1. **Set your name** (appears in commit history):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

2. **Set your email** (this should be the same email you used for GitHub):

```bash
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```
   **Note:**
      you're managing **multiple GitHub accounts** (like `org1`, `proj2`, and `personal`) and want to know:

      1. How to **check which GitHub account is currently "active"** on your system
      2. How to **switch between accounts**
      3. How to **start a new project** using the correct account

      ---

      ## âœ… 1. Check Which GitHub Account is Logged In (Git CLI)

      Git itself doesnâ€™t "log in" â€” it just uses credentials when pushing to remotes. You can check the current Git identity like this:

      ```bash
      git config --global user.name
      git config --global user.email
      ```

      But this shows the **default (global)** identity. For a specific repo:

      ```bash
      git config user.name
      git config user.email
      ```

      If this returns nothing, Git uses the global config.

      ---

      ## ðŸ”„ 2. Switch Between GitHub Accounts

      ### ðŸ”¸ Option A: Use Per-Project Config

      For each project, set the correct user:

      ```bash
      git config user.name "Your Name"
      git config user.email "your-email@org1.com"
      ```

      This saves it to `.git/config` (local to the repo), overriding the global one.

      ---

      ### ðŸ”¸ Option B: Use SSH for Multiple GitHub Accounts

      If you're pushing/pulling to/from **multiple GitHub accounts**, it's best to configure **SSH aliases**:

      #### **Follow step 3, Generate a separate SSH key per account**

   ## ****



3. **Verify the configuration** (optional, to make sure everything is set up):

```bash
git config --global --list
```

---

### **Step 3: Generate SSH Key**

To authenticate with GitHub without entering your username and password every time, you'll generate an SSH key.

#### 3.1 Generate SSH Key Pair

1. Open **Git Bash** (or your terminal) and run the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
E.g.
 ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "padmakar.kotule@gslab.com"
   Generating public/private rsa key pair.
   Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/gs-1062/.ssh/id_rsa): /c/Users/gs-1062/.ssh/id_rsa_padmakar-gslab-github

```

- **`-t rsa`**: Specifies the type of key to create (RSA).
- **`-b 4096`**: Specifies the length of the key (4096 bits).
- **`-C "your_email@example.com"`**: Adds a label to the key for identification (your email).

2. Youâ€™ll see a prompt asking where to save the key. Press **Enter** to accept the default location:

```
/c/Users/YourUser/.ssh/id_rsa
```

3. Youâ€™ll also be asked if you want to set a **passphrase** for the key. This is optional, but itâ€™s recommended for added security.

#### 3.2 Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent

To make sure your SSH key is used by Git, you need to add it to the SSH agent.

1. **Start the SSH agent** (in Git Bash):

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

2. **Add the SSH private key to the agent**:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   E.g.
   $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_padmakar-gslab-github
   Identity added: /c/Users/gs-1062/.ssh/id_rsa_padmakar-gslab-github (padmakar.kotule@gslab.com)

```

---

### **Step 4: Add SSH Key to GitHub**

Now, we need to add your SSH key to GitHub so you can authenticate without entering your credentials each time.

#### 4.1 Copy the SSH Public Key

1. **Display the public key**:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

This will show your public SSH key. It will look like this:

```
ssh-rsa AAAAB3... rest of the key ... your_email@example.com
```

2. **Copy the entire key** (from `ssh-rsa` to your email address).

#### 4.2 Add the SSH Key to GitHub

1. Go to **GitHub** and log in to your account.
2. In the top-right corner of GitHub, click on your profile picture and choose **Settings**.
3. On the left sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.
4. Click the **New SSH key** button.
5. Paste the copied key into the **Key** field and give it a **Title** (e.g., "My Laptop Key").
6. Click **Add SSH key**.

#### 4.3 Test the SSH Connection

Run the following command to verify that your SSH key is working:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message like this:

```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

This means youâ€™ve successfully set up SSH for GitHub!

---

### **Step 5: Create a GitHub Repository**

Now, let's create a remote repository on GitHub where youâ€™ll push your code.

1. Go to **GitHub** and log in.
2. Click on the **+** in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.
3. Name your repository (e.g., `my-project`).
4. Choose **Public** or **Private** (depends on your preference).
5. Do not initialize with a README or any other files.
6. Click **Create repository**.

Once the repository is created, GitHub will show you the **URL** to connect to it. You'll use this to link your local project with the remote GitHub repository.

---

### **Step 6: Connect Local Repository to GitHub**

#### 6.1 Initialize Your Local Repository

If you haven't yet initialized your local project as a Git repository, do so now:

1. Navigate to your project folder:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

2. Initialize Git:

```bash
git init
```

#### 6.2 Add Remote Repository (GitHub)

Now you need to connect your local repository to the remote GitHub repository. Youâ€™ll use the SSH URL provided by GitHub when you created the repository.

1. Copy the **SSH URL** of your GitHub repository (it should look like `git@github.com:username/my-project.git`).
2. Run the following command in your Git Bash or terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/my-project.git

E.g.
   git remote add origin git@github.com:PadmakarKotule-GSLab/my-project.git
```

#### 6.3 Verify the Remote Connection

You can verify that the remote was added correctly by running:

```bash
git remote -v
```

This should display the URL of your GitHub repository.

---

### **Step 7: Make Your First Commit**

#### 7.1 Create or Edit Files

Now letâ€™s make your first commit. Create or edit a file, such as a `README.md`:

```bash
echo "# My Project" > README.md
```

#### 7.2 Stage and Commit the Changes

1. **Stage** the file for commit:

```bash
git add README.md
```

2. **Commit** the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

### **Step 8: Push Your Code to GitHub**

Now that you have committed your changes, you need to **push** them to your GitHub repository.

```bash
git push -u origin master  # Or 'main' if you are using the default branch 'main'

E.g.
   git push -u origin master
```

- Since you are using SSH, Git will authenticate automatically using your SSH key.

---

### **Step 9: Verify on GitHub**

1. Go to your **GitHub repository page**.
2. You should now see your `README.md` file (or any other file you added).
3. This confirms that your local changes were successfully pushed to GitHub!

---

### **Step 10: Working with Branches**

When working on new features or fixes, itâ€™s common practice to use **branches**.
By default when you use "git init" it's create branch as master
You can rename this branch from "master" to "main"

#### 10.1 Create a New Branch

Create and switch to a new branch for your feature or task:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
```

#### 10.2 Make Changes and Commit

1. Make your changes (e.g., edit `README.md` or add new files).
2. **Stage** the changes:

```bash
git add .
```

3. **Commit** the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Added awesome feature"
```

#### 10.3 Push the New Branch

Push your feature branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/awesome-feature
```

---

### **Step 11: Merge Changes**

Once your feature is done and tested, you can merge it back into the `main` branch:

1. **Switch back to `main`** (or `master`):

```bash
git checkout main
```

2. **Merge the feature branch** into `main`:

```bash
git merge feature/awesome-feature
```

3. **Push** the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```


#### Let's modify Step 11 to follow a more standard Git workflow with the following sequence:

- Feature branches are merged into the dev branch.
- After testing and stability, the dev branch is merged into the release branch.
- Finally, the release branch is merged into the main branch for deployment or production-ready code.
This workflow is common in many teams and allows for better separation of different stages of development.
---

### **Step 12: Clean Up (Optional)**

After merging the feature branch, you can delete it locally and remotely:

```bash
# Delete the branch locally
git branch -d feature/awesome-feature

# Delete the branch remotely
git push origin --delete feature/awesome-feature
```

---

### **Summary of Steps**:

1. **Install Git**
2. **Configure Git** (name and email)
3. **Generate SSH Key** (`ssh-keygen`)
4. **Add SSH Key to GitHub**
5. **Create a GitHub repository**
6. **Initialize local repo** (`git init`)
7. **Add remote repo** (`git remote add origin`)

# Step 11
Certainly! Let's modify **Step 11** to follow a more standard Git workflow with the following sequence:

- **Feature branches** are merged into the **`dev`** branch.
- After testing and stability, the **`dev`** branch is merged into the **`release`** branch.
- Finally, the **`release`** branch is merged into the **`main`** branch for deployment or production-ready code.

This workflow is common in many teams and allows for better separation of different stages of development.

---

### **Step 11: Merging Changes Using `dev`, `release`, and `main` Branches**
First create dev branch and add some file
E.g.

  git checkout -b dev
  cat >>testfile.txt
  cat testfile.txt
  git add .
  git commit -m "added test file"
  git status
  git add .
  git commit -m "added test file"
  git push -u origin dev


Hereâ€™s how you can follow this standard branching strategy:

#### **11.1 Feature Branch to `dev`**

1. **Create a feature branch** (if you haven't already):

```bash
git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
```

2. **Make your changes** (e.g., modify files, add new features).

3. **Stage and commit your changes**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented awesome feature"
```

4. **Push your feature branch to GitHub**:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/awesome-feature
```

5. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** from your `feature/awesome-feature` branch to the `dev` branch on GitHub. Once your PR is reviewed and approved, **merge the feature branch into `dev`**.

#### **11.2 Merge `dev` into `release`**

Once your feature branch is merged into `dev` and the `dev` branch has been tested and is stable, it's time to merge `dev` into the `release` branch.

1. **Switch to the `dev` branch**:

```bash
git checkout dev
```

2. **Make sure `dev` is up to date with the remote**:

```bash
git pull origin dev
```

3. **Create or switch to the `release` branch** (if it doesnâ€™t exist yet, create it):

```bash
git checkout -b release/v1.0
```

4. **Merge `dev` into `release`**:

```bash
git merge dev
```

- Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur.
- After merging, run any additional tests to ensure the release branch is stable.

5. **Push the `release` branch** to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin release/v1.0
```

6. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** from your `release` branch to `main` on GitHub once everything is ready for production.

#### **11.3 Merge `release` into `main`**

Once the code in the `release` branch is stable and ready for production, it's time to merge it into `main`.

1. **Switch to the `main` branch**:

```bash
git checkout main
```

2. **Make sure `main` is up to date with the remote**:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

3. **Merge the `release` branch into `main`**:

```bash
git merge release/v1.0
```

4. **Push `main` to GitHub**:

```bash
git push origin main
```

5. Once the merge is complete, your code is now on the **`main`** branch, ready for deployment or production.

#### **11.4 Clean Up Branches (Optional)**

Once the merge process is completed, you may want to delete the feature, `dev`, and `release` branches locally and remotely (if they are no longer needed). Here's how you do that:

1. **Delete feature branch locally** (after itâ€™s merged):

```bash
git branch -d feature/awesome-feature
```

2. **Delete the `release` branch locally** (if no longer needed):

```bash
git branch -d release/v1.0
```

3. **Delete feature branch remotely**:

```bash
git push origin --delete feature/awesome-feature
```

4. **Delete the `release` branch remotely** (if no longer needed):

```bash
git push origin --delete release/v1.0
```

---

### **Summary of Modified Branch Merging Steps:**

1. **Feature branch** â†’ `dev`:
   - Create a feature branch from `dev`.
   - After development, merge it into `dev`.
   
2. **`dev` branch** â†’ `release`:
   - Merge `dev` into `release` for final testing before production.

3. **`release` branch** â†’ `main`:
   - Merge `release` into `main` for production-ready code.
   
4. **Clean up branches**:
   - Delete the feature and release branches locally and remotely (if no longer needed).

---

This process ensures that you're using a structured workflow to manage your development, testing, and production stages effectively. Each branch has its purpose, and the merges are controlled for stability before deploying to `main`. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
