Great â€” let's **start local**, walk through the **step-by-step Git commands**, and then scale it up to a **CD automation plan**. Here's a structured way to go from **manual local testing** to **CI/CD automation**.

---

## âœ… STEP-BY-STEP LOCALLY USING COMMAND LINE

### ðŸ“Œ Goal: Detect what changed since last deploy, and deploy only changed services.

---

### âœ… Step 1: Clone the Repo (if not already)

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Get the Latest Commit

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Example output:

```
abc123def456...
```

Save this SHA as the **"last deployed commit"**. We'll store it in a file:

```bash
echo "abc123def456..." > .last_deployed_commit
```

---

### âœ… Step 3: Make Changes (simulate)

You can now make changes in one or more microservice folders, commit them, etc.

Example:

```bash
cd micro_service25
echo "# change" >> config.yaml
cd ..
git add .
git commit -m "Update micro_service25"
```

---

### âœ… Step 4: Detect What Changed

Now detect changes from the last deployed commit to the current `HEAD`:

```bash
last_commit=$(cat .last_deployed_commit)
current_commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

echo "Diffing from $last_commit to $current_commit"

git diff --name-only "$last_commit" "$current_commit" | cut -d '/' -f1 | sort -u
```

Example output:

```
micro_service25
```

---

### âœ… Step 5: Deploy the Changed Folders

Run:

```bash
for folder in $(git diff --name-only "$last_commit" "$current_commit" | cut -d '/' -f1 | sort -u); do
  if [[ -d "$folder" && -x "$folder/deploy.sh" ]]; then
    echo "Deploying $folder"
    (cd "$folder" && ./deploy.sh)
  else
    echo "Skipping $folder â€” no deploy.sh found or not executable"
  fi
done
```

---

### âœ… Step 6: Update the Last Deployed Commit

Once deployment succeeds:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD > .last_deployed_commit
```

âœ… Done â€” youâ€™ve now deployed only changed microservices, based on commit comparison.

---

## ðŸš€ PLAN FOR CD AUTOMATION

Once local testing is good, automate with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or another tool.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Jenkins Example:

1. Add the `.last_deployed_commit` file in your workspace (or manage via Git tag/artifact).
2. Jenkins pipeline step to:

   * Checkout repo
   * Read `.last_deployed_commit`
   * Compare commits
   * Run the same loop
   * Update `.last_deployed_commit`

You can store the `.last_deployed_commit` in:

* A file in the workspace
* A Git tag (`last-deployed`)
* An external storage (like S3 or Vault, if needed)

---

### ðŸ”„ Optionally: Count the Number of Commits Since Last Deploy

```bash
git rev-list --count "$last_commit..$current_commit"
```

---

## âœ… Summary

| Step | What You Do                                   |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Save current commit SHA (`HEAD`) after deploy |
| 2    | On next run, read that SHA                    |
| 3    | Use `git diff` to detect changed folders      |
| 4    | Loop through them and deploy                  |
| 5    | Update stored SHA                             |

Would you like a full working `deploy.sh` script or a Jenkinsfile next?
