Great scenario ‚Äî this is very realistic in **multi-service mono-repos** where developers independently update versions, and you want to deploy **only what changed**, reliably, even when multiple commits are pushed together.

---

## ‚úÖ Your Setup Recap (Clarified)

* You have **a monorepo**, e.g.:

  ```
  repo/
    microservice1/version.txt
    microservice2/version.txt
    ...
  ```
* Developers edit only `version.txt` in the service they want to deploy.
* They commit and push (possibly multiple commits, possibly multiple devs).
* You want a CD script to:

  * Know **which `version.txt` files changed**
  * Read the **last line of those version.txt**
  * Deploy the matching Helm chart version
* Challenge: **New commits are already pushed**, so how do you detect what changed **since last deploy**?

---

## ‚úÖ The Core Problem

You can‚Äôt just check `HEAD~1` ‚Üí `HEAD`, because:

* Multiple commits may be pushed
* You may have missed intermediate ones

---

## ‚úÖ ‚úÖ Solution: Use `last-deployed` Git Tag to Track Last Successful Deploy

You **must store the last deployed commit SHA** ‚Äî either via:

* A Git tag (recommended)
* A file in the repo
* Jenkins workspace

Then, your deploy script compares:

```bash
git diff <last-deployed> HEAD
```

This gets **all changes** since last successful deploy, no matter how many commits were pushed.

---

## ‚úÖ Workflow Step-by-Step

1. **Tag the last successful deploy** with:

   ```bash
   git tag -f last-deployed HEAD
   git push --force origin last-deployed
   ```

2. **On the next run**, get changed `version.txt` files:

   ```bash
   git diff --name-only last-deployed HEAD | grep 'version.txt'
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   microservice1/version.txt
   microservice9/version.txt
   ```

3. **For each changed file**, get last line of `version.txt`:

   ```bash
   while read -r file; do
     service_dir=$(dirname "$file")
     version=$(tail -n1 "$file")
     echo "Deploying $service_dir with version $version"
     # your helm deployment here
   done < <(git diff --name-only last-deployed HEAD | grep 'version.txt')
   ```

4. **After successful deploy**, update the `last-deployed` tag:

   ```bash
   git tag -f last-deployed HEAD
   git push origin --force --tags
   ```

---

## ‚úÖ Complete Bash Script Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

last_commit=$(git rev-parse last-deployed 2>/dev/null || git rev-parse HEAD~1)
current_commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

echo "üîç Checking for changed version.txt files between:"
echo "  From: $last_commit"
echo "  To:   $current_commit"

# Get only version.txt changes
changed_versions=$(git diff --name-only "$last_commit" "$current_commit" | grep 'version.txt')

if [ -z "$changed_versions" ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ No version.txt files changed ‚Äî skipping deploy."
  exit 0
fi

# Loop through changed services
while read -r file; do
  service_dir=$(dirname "$file")
  version=$(tail -n1 "$file")
  
  echo "üöÄ Deploying $service_dir with version $version"

  # Pull Helm chart and deploy (replace this with your logic)
  helm upgrade --install "$service_dir" ./helm-charts/"$service_dir" --version "$version" -f "$service_dir/values.yaml" --namespace uat

done <<< "$changed_versions"

# Update tag after successful deploy
git tag -f last-deployed "$current_commit"
git push origin --force --tags

echo "‚úÖ All services deployed successfully. Updated last-deployed tag to $current_commit."
```

## ‚úÖ Summary: Why This Works

| Feature                       | Benefit                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git diff last-deployed HEAD` | Detects **all** changed services since last deployment        |
| Tag-based tracking            | Avoids fragile reliance on `HEAD~1`                           |
| Reads only `version.txt`      | Ensures only services that **request deployment** are touched |
| Deploys per service/version   | Clean, auditable deploy behavior                              |
| Git tag update                | Enables stateful CD across pushes & reboots                   |

Would you like me to turn this into a **Jenkins pipeline**, or package this into a GitHub Action next?
