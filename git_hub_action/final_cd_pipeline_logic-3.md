You're exactly right — if you **track the last deployed commit**, then every time someone pushes new code, the rest becomes very simple: just compare the latest commit (`HEAD`) with the `last_commit`, and deploy what's changed.

And yes, **you can keep it simple**, without tagging, without branching, and without `HEAD~n` guesswork.

## ✅ Simple & Reliable Approach Using Git Commit History

Here’s a clean, minimal solution that:

1. Tracks the last deployed commit using a file (or external store).
2. Finds the latest commit.
3. Compares the two.
4. Deploys Helm charts based on updated `version.txt` files.

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step

#### 🟨 1. On first run: Save the current commit SHA as `last_commit`

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD > .last_deployed_commit
```

> ✅ Save it in a file inside Jenkins workspace, or even inside Git if you're OK committing it.

---

#### 🟩 2. In each deployment run:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Step 1: Read last deployed commit
if [ -f .last_deployed_commit ]; then
  last_commit=$(cat .last_deployed_commit)
else
  echo "🟡 First-time deploy — setting last_commit to first commit"
  last_commit=$(git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD)
fi

# Step 2: Get the latest commit
latest_commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

echo "🔍 Comparing from $last_commit to $latest_commit"

# Step 3: Find changed version.txt files
changed_versions=$(git diff --name-only "$last_commit" "$latest_commit" | grep 'version.txt')

if [ -z "$changed_versions" ]; then
  echo "✅ No version.txt files changed — nothing to deploy."
  exit 0
fi

# Step 4: Deploy each updated service
while read -r file; do
  service_dir=$(dirname "$file")
  version=$(tail -n1 "$file")
  echo "🚀 Deploying $service_dir with version $version"
  helm upgrade --install "$service_dir" ./helm-charts/"$service_dir" \
    --version "$version" \
    -f "$service_dir/values.yaml" \
    --namespace uat
done <<< "$changed_versions"

# Step 5: Save latest commit as new last_commit
echo "$latest_commit" > .last_deployed_commit
```

## ✅ Summary

| Step                    | Tool                         | Simplicity              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Track last commit       | `.last_deployed_commit` file | ✅ No tagging complexity |
| Find latest commit      | `git rev-parse HEAD`         | ✅ Standard              |
| Compare commits         | `git diff last HEAD`         | ✅ Accurate              |
| Find services to deploy | `grep version.txt`           | ✅ Microservice-aware    |

---

### 🔁 Optional Enhancements

* Save `.last_deployed_commit` as:

  * Git commit (`git add` + `git commit`)
  * CI/CD artifact (Jenkins workspace, GitHub cache, S3, etc.)
* Add email/slack notification
* Add dry-run mode

---

Would you like this turned into:

* A Jenkins declarative pipeline block?
* A GitHub Actions workflow YAML?
* A portable shell script with logging and dry-run?
