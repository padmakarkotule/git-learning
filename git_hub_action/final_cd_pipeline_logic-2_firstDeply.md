Great follow-up â€” handling the **first-time deployment** (i.e., when no `last-deployed` tag exists yet) needs a **safe and controlled fallback**, so that you donâ€™t deploy everything blindly or skip necessary changes.

---

## âœ… First-Time Deployment Strategy

Weâ€™ll handle first-time deployment by:

1. Checking if the `last-deployed` tag exists.
2. If **yes** â†’ do a `git diff last-deployed HEAD` (normal case).
3. If **no** â†’ fallback to either:

   * Deploy nothing (safe, explicit first deploy trigger).
   * Deploy only current `HEAD` (e.g., last commit).
   * Deploy **everything** under `projects/*/version.txt` (common in bootstrapping).

---

### âœ… Option 1: Deploy Nothing (Manual Bootstrapping)

```bash
if git rev-parse --verify last-deployed >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  last_commit=$(git rev-parse last-deployed)
else
  echo "ðŸŸ¡ First-time deploy detected. Skipping until 'last-deployed' tag is manually created."
  exit 0
fi
```

> âœ… **Best if you want full control over first deploy.**

---

### âœ… Option 2: Fallback to Previous Commit (`HEAD~1`)

```bash
last_commit=$(git rev-parse last-deployed 2>/dev/null || git rev-parse HEAD~1)
```

> âœ… **Safe** if you assume last commit is deployable.

---

### âœ… Option 3: Deploy All `version.txt` Files (Initial Bootstrapping)

```bash
if git rev-parse --verify last-deployed >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  last_commit=$(git rev-parse last-deployed)
  changed_versions=$(git diff --name-only "$last_commit" HEAD | grep 'version.txt')
else
  echo "ðŸŸ¡ First-time deploy â€” selecting all version.txt files."
  changed_versions=$(find projects -name version.txt)
fi
```

> âœ… **Good if you want to deploy everything once** during first rollout.

---

## âœ… Updated Script Snippet with First-Time Handling

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

if git rev-parse --verify last-deployed >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  last_commit=$(git rev-parse last-deployed)
  changed_versions=$(git diff --name-only "$last_commit" HEAD | grep 'version.txt')
else
  echo "ðŸŸ¡ First-time deploy â€” deploying all version.txt files."
  changed_versions=$(find projects -name version.txt)
fi

if [ -z "$changed_versions" ]; then
  echo "âœ… No version.txt files changed â€” nothing to deploy."
  exit 0
fi

while read -r file; do
  service_dir=$(dirname "$file")
  version=$(tail -n1 "$file")
  echo "ðŸš€ Deploying $service_dir with version $version"
  # Replace with real helm deploy
  helm upgrade --install "$service_dir" ./helm-charts/"$service_dir" --version "$version" -f "$service_dir/values.yaml" --namespace uat
done <<< "$changed_versions"

# Tag only if this is not first run
current_commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
git tag -f last-deployed "$current_commit"
git push origin --force --tags

echo "âœ… All services deployed. 'last-deployed' updated to $current_commit"
```

## âœ… Summary: First-Time Deployment Options

| Strategy                 | Behavior                    | Best For               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Skip                     | No deploy unless tag exists | Safe, cautious CI/CD   |
| HEAD\~1 fallback         | Deploy just last commit     | Small teams/testing    |
| Deploy all `version.txt` | Bootstrap entire env        | First-time infra setup |

---

Let me know if you want to add:

* Logging to a file
* GitHub/GitLab webhook support
* Helm dry-run before real deploy

Or should we now turn this into a Jenkins pipeline or GitHub Actions YAML?
