Great question.

### 🔎 Is `dawidd6/action-send-mail` official?

**No**, `dawidd6/action-send-mail` is **not developed or officially maintained by GitHub**, but it is:

* **Popular** (used in thousands of workflows)
* **Well-maintained** (as of 2024)
* **Open source**
* **Actively updated**
* ✅ Works reliably for sending email via SMTP (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

That said, since it's a **third-party GitHub Action**, it comes with the usual caveats:

* You must **trust the author and source code** (which you can inspect [here](https://github.com/dawidd6/action-send-mail)).
* GitHub doesn't **officially endorse or support** third-party Actions.

## ✅ Alternative GitHub-Supported Options

GitHub doesn’t currently provide an **official email notification action**, but here are a few **safe and practical alternatives**:

---

### 🔹 Option 1: **Use an internal mail API (e.g., company SMTP, SendGrid, Mailgun)**

Write a shell script in your workflow using `curl` or `mailx`:

```yaml
- name: Send Email via Curl + API
  if: ${{ failure() }}
  run: |
    curl -X POST https://api.mailgun.net/v3/yourdomain.com/messages \
      -u 'api:${{ secrets.MAILGUN_API_KEY }}' \
      -F from="GitHub Action <noreply@yourdomain.com>" \
      -F to="dev-team@yourdomain.com" \
      -F subject="❌ Deployment Failed" \
      -F text="The deployment failed for ${{ github.repository }} at commit ${{ github.sha }}."
```

✅ This gives you full control, works with enterprise policies, and avoids relying on third-party Actions.

---

### 🔹 Option 2: **Use GitHub Actions → Slack → Email Relay**

If your team uses **Slack or Teams**, you can send messages to a **channel that’s configured to notify by email** (e.g., Slack channel with email integration).

---

### 🔹 Option 3: **Self-Hosted SMTP Script**

If you run your own Jenkins/CI servers, use `sendmail`, `mailx`, or `ssmtp` in your Docker environment.

Example step (Linux-only):

```yaml
- name: Send Email (native)
  if: ${{ failure() }}
  run: |
    echo "Subject: Deployment Failed
From: github@yourdomain.com
To: team@yourdomain.com

The deployment failed for ${{ github.repository }} at commit ${{ github.sha }}" | sendmail -t
```

> 🔐 Make sure `sendmail` is installed in your runner environment and your SMTP is configured.

## ✅ Recommendation

| Goal                      | Best Option                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Quick setup (Gmail, etc.) | ✅ `dawidd6/action-send-mail`   |
| Corporate/secure env      | ✅ `curl` with Mailgun/SendGrid |
| Total control             | ✅ Shell-based SMTP/email       |
| Notification to channel   | ✅ Slack + channel email        |

---

Would you like a **ready-to-go template** using `curl` and a known service like **SendGrid** or **Mailgun** instead?
