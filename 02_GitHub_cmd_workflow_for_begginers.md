# Git commands based on the workflow

Itâ€™s a great idea to categorize Git commands based on the workflow to make it easier for newcomers to understand how Git works. Here's how you can break it down into **logical categories** to help new developers grasp the sequence and purpose of each command.

1. **Category 1: Initial Setup & Repository Management**
2. **Category 2: Working with Branches**
3. **Category 3: Staging, Committing, and Pushing Changes with tags**
4. **Category 4: Updating Your Local Repository**
5. **Category 5: Handling Conflicts and Temporary Work**
6. **Category 6: Working with Tags and Remotes**
7. **Category 7: Cleaning Up and Removing Files**

### **Category 3: Staging, Committing, and Pushing Changes (Including Tags)**

This category helps you track and save changes to your local repository, push them to a remote repository, and optionally tag them for future reference.

| **Command**             | **Purpose**                                                                | **Example**                                                            |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`git add`**            | Stage changes to be committed.                                             | `git add index.html`                                                   |
| **`git commit`**         | Commit the staged changes with a message describing the change.             | `git commit -m "Added new feature to index.html"`                       |

| **`git tag`**            | Tag a specific commit to mark it for reference (e.g., for releases).       | `git tag v1.0`                                                          |
| **`git log`**            | View the commit history of your current branch.                            | `git log`                                                              |

#### **Explanation**:
- **`git add`**: Stage your modified files, telling Git to include them in the next commit.
- **`git commit`**: Record the staged changes in the local repository with a descriptive commit message.
- **`git push`**: Upload your committed changes to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
- **`git tag`**: Create a tag for a specific commit. This is often used for marking releases or important milestones in the project history.
- **`git log`**: View the history of commits and tags on the current branch.


#### **Examples**:
- **`git add`**: Stage your modified files, telling Git to include them in the next commit.
- **`git commit`**: Record the staged changes in the local repository with a descriptive commit message.
- **`git push`**: Upload your committed changes to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
- **`git tag`**: Create a tag for a specific commit. This is often used for marking releases or important milestones in the project history.
- **`git log`**: View the history of commits and tags on the current branch.

### Example Workflow with `git tag`:

1. **Stage and Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Fixed bug in index.html"
   ```

2. **Create a Tag** (e.g., marking a release):
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0
   ```

3. **Push Changes and Tags**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/awesome-feature
   git push origin v1.0  # Push the tag to the remote
   ```

By placing `git tag` in Category 3, we reflect the fact that it's part of your typical Git workflow after committing and before pushing changes (or tagging a specific commit to mark a release). It follows logically after pushing changes, as you may want to create a tag just before or after pushing commits to the remote.

### **Category 4: Updating Your Local Repository**

This category involves pulling changes from remote repositories to ensure your local repository stays up to date.

| **Command**             | **Purpose**                                                                | **Example**                                                         |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`git fetch`**          | Fetch the latest changes from the remote without merging them.             | `git fetch origin`                                                  |
| **`git pull`**           | Fetch and merge the latest changes from the remote repository into your current branch. | `git pull origin main`                                               |

#### **Explanation**:
- **`git fetch`**: Retrieve the latest changes from the remote without modifying your working directory.
- **`git pull`**: Fetch the latest changes and merge them into your current branch.

#### **Examples**:
- **`git fetch`**: Retrieve the latest changes from the remote without modifying your working directory.
- **`git pull`**: Fetch the latest changes and merge them into your current branch.
 
- `Example - git fetch`:
   1. Open github.com from web site, go to your repository and change the README.md file, commit and update the change.
   2. On local use command `git fetch`
   3. Check the **status of your local branch compared to the remote**
      You can also use git status to get a summary of how your local branch relates to the remote:
      git command - `git status`
      
      E.g. 
      $ git status
      On branch main
      Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
      ----------------    --------------- -- --------
      (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
      -------------------------------------------

      nothing to commit, working tree clean

   4. Compare all local and remote branches
      If you want to compare all branches at once (both local and remote), you can use:
      git commands - `git fetch --all` and `git diff --stat --name-only main..origin/main`
      E.g.
      $ git diff --stat --name-only main..origin/main
      README.md

   5. Compare the local branch with the remote branch
      command  - git diff <local-branch>..<remote>/<remote-branch>
      E.g.
      git diff main..origin/main
      E.g. output
      $ git diff main..origin/main
      diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
      index 635a75d..4eb0e4a 100644
      --- a/README.md
      +++ b/README.md

   6. Check for differences in commits (Using **git log** command)
      If you want to see the commit differences between your local branch and the remote branch, you can use:
      git command - `git log <local-branch>..<remote>/<remote-branch>`
      E.g.
      git log <local-branch>..<remote>/<remote-branch>
      $ git log main..origin/main
