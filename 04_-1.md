Yes — **you can absolutely enforce a workflow where:**

* ✅ Developers **can’t merge feature branches directly into `main`**
* ✅ Code must first go through `develop`
* ✅ Only **release branches** created from `develop` can be used to merge into `main`

This is a **controlled Git flow** and can be enforced with a combination of:

---

## 🔒 1. Branch Protection Rules

### On `main` branch:

* ✅ **Require PRs before merging**
* ✅ **Restrict who can push**
* ✅ **Require status checks (CI)**
* ✅ **Require branch to be up to date with `release/*` branch**
* ✅ **Use CODEOWNERS or reviewer rules** so only leads or automation can approve

➡️ This stops any direct merge from feature/dev into `main`.

---

## 🛠️ 2. Use PR Rules & Naming Conventions

### Suggested Branch Naming:

* `feature/*` → for individual features
* `develop` → main working branch
* `release/*` → created from `develop` to prep for production
* `main` → production only

### Suggested Workflow:

```text
feature/xyz 
   ↓ PR → develop 
       ↓ PR → release/v1.2 
             ↓ PR → main
```

---

## 🔐 3. Use GitHub Rules or GitHub Actions (or GitLab equivalents)

### Enforce via GitHub Actions / CI:

You can use automation to **block merges into `main`** unless:

* The source branch starts with `release/`
* The PR is approved by a code owner or automation bot
* The PR base is not `main` unless the source is `release/*`

Here’s a sample GitHub Action condition in a workflow:

```yaml
if: github.base_ref == 'main' && !startsWith(github.head_ref, 'release/')
```

---

## ✅ 4. Optional: Use CODEOWNERS

To prevent developers from merging into protected branches, define reviewers in a `.github/CODEOWNERS` file:

```txt
# Require lead dev approval for merges to main
/main @lead-devs
/release/* @release-managers
```

This ensures only authorized users can approve/merge to certain branches.

## 🧠 Final Workflow Example

| Branch      | Who Works On It  | Allowed Merges From     | Notes                              |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `feature/*` | Developers       | N/A                     | Individual dev work                |
| `develop`   | Developers       | `feature/*` via PR      | Shared integration branch          |
| `release/*` | Lead/devops      | `develop` via PR        | Final testing, prep for prod       |
| `main`      | Release managers | `release/*` via PR only | Production branch, fully protected |

---

## ✅ Tools That Help

* GitHub Branch Rules
* GitHub Actions (for merge checks)
* CODEOWNERS file
* Pre-merge checks via CI tools (Jenkins, CircleCI, etc.)

Would you like me to create a sample `.github/CODEOWNERS` and branch protection setup template for GitHub, or do you use GitLab/Bitbucket?
