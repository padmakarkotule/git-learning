I can’t create a GitHub repo directly for you, but I’ll give you **all the files and instructions** to set it up yourself quickly. You (or your team) can create the repo with this exact structure and content.

# How to Create Your GitHub Workflow Lab Repo (with starter files + README)

### 1. Create a new repo on GitHub:

* Name: `workflow-lab`
* Public or private as you prefer
* **Do NOT initialize with README or gitignore**

---

### 2. Clone locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/workflow-lab.git
cd workflow-lab
```

---

### 3. Create files:

**3.1 `README.md`** — Paste the entire markdown I gave you above.

**3.2 `index.html`** — Starter HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Workflow Lab</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Hello from version <span id="version"></span></h1>
<script>
fetch('version.txt')
  .then(res => res.text())
  .then(version => document.getElementById('version').innerText = version);
</script>
<footer><p>Created by team</p></footer>
</body>
</html>
```

**3.3 `version.txt`**

```
0.1.0
```

---

### 4. Commit and push:

```bash
git add README.md index.html version.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add workflow lab README and starter files"
git push origin main
```

---

### 5. Create `develop` branch:

```bash
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop
```

---

Now your repo is ready for your team to start working following the lab steps in `README.md`.

If you want, I can prepare this as a ZIP you can download and unzip locally, or guide you step-by-step to use GitHub CLI or GitHub UI for creating the repo. Just ask!
