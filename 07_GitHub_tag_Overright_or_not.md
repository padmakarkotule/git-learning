Great question! Here's the straight answer:

## ❓ Can Git Tags Be Overwritten?

### 🛑 By Default: **NO**

* Git **does not allow overwriting (moving) a tag** on a remote by default.
* If someone tries to push a tag (`1.0.1`) that already exists on the remote (e.g., GitHub), they'll get an error like:

```
error: failed to push some refs to 'origin'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tag already exists in the remote.
```

---

## ✅ But: **It *can* be force-overwritten (not recommended)**

Someone can force-push a tag using:

```bash
git tag -f 1.0.1
git push origin --force tag 1.0.1
```

> ⚠️ This rewrites history and is **strongly discouraged** unless there's a critical reason — especially on production tags.

## 💡 Best Practices

* **Do not reuse or overwrite tags**, especially for releases.
* Use a new version (e.g., `1.0.2`) even for small updates.
* Protect tags in GitHub (manually or via workflows) if needed.

## 🔐 Optional: Protect Tags in GitHub

While GitHub doesn't support tag protection directly in UI yet, you can use:

* GitHub Actions to **fail PRs** or **block pushes** to existing tags
* Branch naming rules to avoid tag misuses (if automated)

Let me know if you'd like a GitHub Action that prevents overwriting tags, and I can provide one.
