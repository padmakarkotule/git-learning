# GitHub Branching Strategy (Workflow for Multi-Repo) 
## Hands-on Lab (Beginner Friendly) for Multi-Repository only and not for Mono-Repository.

Learn GitHub Branching Strategy (workflow) step by step using a simple web page (`index.html`) 
and a `version.txt` file to track and deploy changes across environments.

---

## 🧰 Step 1: Setup Project

### 1.1 Create a GitHub Repository
- Go to **https://github.com**
- Click **"New"** → Create a repo named **`branching-strategy-lab`**
- Do **not** initialize with README or `.gitignore`

### 1.2 Clone the Repository

    ```bash
    # git clone https://github.com/padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git (Using https)
        **Using ssh**
    git clone git@github.com:padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git 
    cd branching-strategy-lab
    ```
### 1.3 Add Initial Files


#### Create index.html file. E.g. vi index.html 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Workflow Lab</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Hello from version <span id="version"></span></h1>
<script>
fetch('version.txt')
  .then(res => res.text())
  .then(version => document.getElementById('version').innerText = version);
</script>
</body>
</html>
```
    Save file with name index.html.

#### version.txt

```bash
echo "1.0.0" > version.txt
```

### 1.4 Commit and Push to Main

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with version 1.0.0"
git push origin main
```

---
##### Naming Recommendation for Branches and Tags
    | Purpose      | Recommended Name |
    | ------------ | ---------------- |
    | Main (prod)  | `main`           |
    | Development  | `develop`        |
    | Feature work | `feature/xyz`    |
    | Release prep | `release/vX.Y.Z` |
    | Hotfix       | `hotfix/issue`   |
    | Bugfix (QA)  | `bugfix/issue`   |

E.g.
Recommended Practice
Use:
 - Branch: hotfix/fix-login
 - Tag after merge: 1.0.1-hotfix
| Branch Type | Name               | Tag            |
| ----------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| hotfix      | `hotfix/fix-login` | `v1.0.1-hotfix` |
| bugfix      | `bugfix/css-issue` | `v1.0.2-bugfix` |
| release     | `release/v1.0.0`   | `v1.0.0`        |

- Tags are your canonical version markers (v1.0.1-hotfix)
- Branch names are for working context (hotfix/login-crash, bugfix/css-spacing)
- Keeping them separate but related is the cleanest approach

## 🚀 Step 2: Feature Development Workflow

### 2.1 Create `develop` Branch

```bash
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop
```
**Note** - When you use checkout -b develop, in this case all content from main are copied to develop brnach, 
         - So, no need to raise PR
         - You can use it later changes.
E.g.

```bash 
    $ git push origin develop
    Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    remote:
    remote: Create a pull request for 'develop' on GitHub by visiting:
    remote:      https://github.com/padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab/pull/new/develop
    remote:
    To github.com:padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git
    * [new branch]      develop -> develop
```
**Tips:**
-  Do you need a PR from main → develop at this point?
    - Since you created the develop branch after adding files to main, 
    - the develop branch was created from main at that moment, so the contents are identical right now.
    Not necessary, if:
    - You created develop directly from main (which you did), and
    - You haven’t made any additional changes in main after creating develop.
-  Best Practice Going Forward
    - All development starts from develop
    - Only release/* or hotfix/* branches should ever pull changes from main
    - Use PRs even for main → develop merges to keep process consistent.

### 2.2 Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-footer
```

### 2.3 Modify `index.html`

Add footer:

```html
<footer><p>Created by Padmakar Kotule</p></footer>
```

### 2.4 Commit and Push

```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add footer to index"
git push origin feature/add-footer
```

    This will show following output,
```bash
$ git push origin feature/add-footer
    Enumerating objects: 5, done.
    Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
    Delta compression using up to 8 threads
    Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 416 bytes | 208.00 KiB/s, done.
    Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.
    remote:
    remote: Create a pull request for 'feature/add-footer' on GitHub by visiting:
    remote:      https://github.com/padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab/pull/new/feature/add-footer
    remote:
    To github.com:padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git
    * [new branch]      feature/add-footer -> feature/add-footer
```

### 2.5 Raise Pull Request (PR) to `develop`

#### Steps to Raise PR on GitHub

1. Go to **[https://github.com/](https://github.com/)padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab**
2. You’ll see a banner: “Compare & pull request” → Click it
   *OR:* Click **"Pull requests"** → **"New pull request"**
3. Select:

   * **Base branch:** `develop`
   * **Compare branch:** `feature/add-footer`
4. Click **"Create pull request"**
5. Enter title & description (e.g. “Added footer section to index.html”)

6. After review, click **"Merge pull request"**
7. Then click **"Delete branch"** if prompted

### Sync your local develop branch with remote
-  Go to your develop branch
`git checkout develop`
- Go to your develop branch
`git pull origin develop`


---

## 📦 Step 3: Release Preparation

### 3.1 Bump Version in `develop`

```bash
git checkout develop
echo "1.0.1" >> version.txt
git add version.txt
git commit -m "Updated version to 1.0.1"
git push origin develop
```
## IMP - You Might Have Skipped PR in This Case and try to aviod this**
**Better Practice (With PR)**
## Suggested steps (Instead of given above):

# 1. Checkout a temporary branch for the version updates
git checkout -b version/update-1.0.1

# 2. Edit version.txt
echo "1.0.1" >> version.txt

# 3. Commit
git add version.txt
git commit -m "Update version to 1.0.1 for upcoming release"

# 4. Push
git push origin version/update-1.0.1

E.g. output
```bash
    $ git push origin version/update-1.0.1
    Enumerating objects: 5, done.
    Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
    Delta compression using up to 8 threads
    Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 292 bytes | 292.00 KiB/s, done.
    Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.
    remote:
    remote: Create a pull request for 'version/update-1.0.1' on GitHub by visiting:
    remote:      https://github.com/padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab/pull/new/version/update-1.0.1
    remote:
    To github.com:padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git
    * [new branch]      version/update-1.0.1 -> version/update-1.0.1
```
5. Create a Pull Request
    - Open GitHub
    - Compare: version/update-1.0.1 → develop
    - Add description: why you're updating the version
    - Submit for review
    - Merge once approved


### 3.2 Create Release Branch from `main`

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release/v1.0.1
git push origin release/v1.0.1

# output
$ git push origin release/v1.0.1
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote:
remote: Create a pull request for 'release/v1.0.1' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab/pull/new/release/v1.0.1
remote:
To github.com:padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git
 * [new branch]      release/v1.0.1 -> release/v1.0.1

```

### 3.3 Raise PR: `develop` → `release/v1.0.1`

#### PR Steps

1. Go to GitHub → "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
2. **Base branch**: `release/v1.0.1`
3. **Compare branch**: `develop`
4. Review, then click **"Create pull request"**
5. After review, click **"Merge pull request"**

**Note**
In this scenario, make sure that base branch is `release/v1.0.1` and Compare branch is `develop`.
This will show in GitHub UI too, as `data will copy from develop to release/v1.0.1`
E.g. In UI it will show as,
 `release/v1.0.1` (base branch) <--- `develop`(Compare branch)

---

## 🏷️ Step 4: Tag and Final Merge

### 4.1 Raise PR: `release/v1.0.1` → `main`

##### When to Use git tag

- Tag After Merge to main
- `**You should create the Git tag after the PR is merged from release/* to main.**`
Why ?
Reason                                     
- Tag = production-ready snapshot 
    (Once the release PR is merged into main, the commit on main is the one that’s been reviewed and approved. 
    This is what you want to tag and deploy.)         
- Clean history (Tagging before the merge can result in the tag pointing to a commit that’s not actually on main yet.) 
- CI/CD compatibility (Most CI/CD pipelines are triggered by tags on the main branch (e.g., on: push: tags:). )

###### **Typical Workflow Example**
        # Assume you're on release/v1.0.1 and it's ready
        # Create a PR: release/v1.0.1 → main

        # Once the PR is merged into main:
        git checkout main
        git pull origin main

        # Now tag the latest commit on main
        git tag -a 1.0.1 -m "Release version 1.0.1"
        git push origin 1.0.1

###### **Optional: Automate Tagging with CI and `IMP DevOps uses this in CI pipeline`**
#### PR Steps

1. Go to GitHub → "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
2. **Base**: `main`
3. **Compare**: `release/v0.2.0`
4. Review and click **"Create pull request"**
5. Merge when approved


### 4.2 Tag the Release
There are two options to use tag. 
1. lightweight tags and
2. Annotated Tags

E.g. of lightweight tag
```bash
git checkout main
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```

E.g. of Annotated tag

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Release version 1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1

# You can inspect your tag like this
git show v1.0.1

```

# Output of git push origin v1.0.1
    $ git push origin v1.0.1
    Enumerating objects: 1, done.
    Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (1/1), 175 bytes | 58.00 KiB/s, done.
    Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    To github.com:padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git
    * [new tag]         v1.0.1 -> v1.0.1

- This creates an annotated tag
    - Includes:
        - Author 
        - Date 
        - commit message (-m)
        - Optional GPG signature 
        - Stored as a full Git object
- Git Automatically Captures:
    | Metadata      | Source                                           |
    | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | **Author**    | From your Git config (`user.name`, `user.email`) |
    | **Date/Time** | The moment the tag is created                    |
    | **Message**   | From the `-m` flag                               |

### Example output of git show v1.0.1 command
```bash
    $ git show v1.0.1
    tag v1.0.1
    Tagger: Padmakar Kotule <padmakar.kotule@gmail.com>
    Date:   Tue May 27 13:28:40 2025 +0530

    Release version v1.0.1

    commit 06ffea819571f430525b4e412209853ff07c22e6 (HEAD -> main, tag: v1.0.1, origin/main)
    Merge: dab55b6 3502d30
    Author: Padmakar Kotule <padmakar.kotule@gmail.com>
    Date:   Tue May 27 13:20:26 2025 +0530

        Merge pull request #5 from padmakarkotule/release/v1.0.1

        Release/v1.0.1
```

**Preferred for releases and version control**
**Note** - Tag is pushed (manually or CI, and prefereed way is by using in CI by reading version.txt file)

    remote:
    To github.com:padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git
    * [new branch]      bugfix/fix-footer-spacing -> bugfix/fix-footer-spacing
```

### 6.5 Tag for Bugfix

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.1-bugfix -m "Bugfix: updated footer"

 * [new tag]         v1.0.1-bugfix -> v1.0.1-bugfix
```


### 6.5 Bugfix in `develop` branch and raise PR

#### PR Steps (Imp)
**Be careful while creating PR, as there are chances for conflict of merge** 
**If you directly raise PR from bugfix/fix-footer branch and merge in develop then you will see merge conflict**
```bash
    E.g.
    1. Go to GitHub → Pull Requests → "New pull request"
    2. **Base**: `develop`
    3. **Compare**: `bugfix/fix-footer-spacing`
    4. Create and merge PR

    **Now here you will see the conflict of merge**
    E.g.
    1.0.0
    1.0.1
    <<<<<<< bugfix/fix-footer-spacing
    1.0.1-bugfix
    =======
    1.0.1-hotfix
    >>>>>>> develop
```

**The reason for this is,**
- You have already updated "version.txt" in develop with code as "1.0.1-hotfix" 
- and now you are updating develop branch again with updated version.txt with containet "1.0.1-bugfix" from `bugfix/fix-footer-spacing` and this branch have code from tag v1.0.1 which is older compare to develop.

###### Correct Steps to Bugfix in develop branch

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-footer-spacing-in-dev
git push origin bugfix/fix-footer-spacing-in-dev
```
```bash
# Output of git push origin bugfix/fix-footer-spacing-in-dev
# Note: In output it shows the create a pull request for git push origin bugfix/fix-footer-spacing-in-dev url
    $ git push origin bugfix/fix-footer-spacing-in-dev

```
**Raise PR and merge code**
1. Go to GitHub → Pull Requests → "New pull request"
2. **Base**: `develop`
3. **Compare**: `bugfix/fix-footer-spacing`
4. Create and merge PR
```

## 🌐 Step 7: Test Version in Browser

When running locally or deployed (via GitHub Pages or any server), you should see:

```plaintext
Hello from version 1.0.1
```

✅ Confirms which version is live by reading `version.txt`.

---

## 🧼 Step 8: Cleanup Merged Branches

- Cleaning up merged branches is a great housekeeping habit, especially when you follow a PR-based workflow
- Let's walk through how to safely clean up merged branches — both locally and on GitHub (remote).

#### 8.1: Step-by-Step: Clean Up Merged Branches

##### Show all merged branches into current branch:
```bash
git branch --merged
```
This lists local branches already merged into your current branch (usually develop or main).

##### Delete all safe-to-delete local merged branches:

**Deletes all merged branches except main and develop**
```bash
    git branch --merged | grep -vE '^\*|main|develop' | xargs -n 1 git branch -d
    # Output
    $ git branch --merged | grep -vE '^\*|main|develop' | xargs -n 1 git branch -d
    Deleted branch bugfix/fix-footer-spacing (was 6ab5569).
    Deleted branch feature/add-footer (was ef16972).
    Deleted branch hotfix/fix-title (was 2eb9e3b).
    Deleted branch release/v1.0.1 (was dab55b6).
    Deleted branch version/update-1.0.1 (was d5fdf98).
```

**Or manually you can delete any single branch**
- Use -D instead of -d if a branch is not fully merged but you want to force delete (not recommended in most cases).
```bash
git branch -d bugfix/fix-footer-spacing
# Output
    $ git branch -d bugfix/fix-footer-spacing-in-dev
    error: the branch 'bugfix/fix-footer-spacing-in-dev' is not fully merged.
    If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D bugfix/fix-footer-spacing-in-dev'

#####  8.2: Clean Up Remote Merged Branches (e.g. on GitHub)
1. Option A: Delete via GitHub UI
    - Go to the Pull Requests tab
    - Open "Closed" PRs
    - If the PR is merged, you'll see a button:
    ✅ This branch was merged. [Delete branch]
2. Option B: Delete from CLI
    - You can delete remote branches like this:
    - git push origin --delete bugfix/fix-footer-spacing

**Repeat for any other merged branches you no longer need.**

##### 8.3:  Automate Remote Cleanup (Advanced)
If you have a lot of merged PR branches cluttering GitHub, you can use:
- GitHub CLI (gh) to list merged PRs and delete their branches
- GitHub Action to auto-delete merged PR branches
- GitHub repository settings to auto-delete branches after merge

**Enable Auto-Delete Merged Branches (Recommended)**
- GitHub Settings → Branches → [x] Automatically delete head branches
- This will auto-delete feature branches after PRs are merged ✅

**Best Practices Summary**
| Task           | Tool                                    | Notes                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Local cleanup  | `git branch --merged`                   | Safe to delete only fully merged branches |
| Remote cleanup | GitHub UI or `git push origin --delete` | Clean after PR merge                      |
| Auto delete    | GitHub repo settings                    | Enable once for all future PRs            |
| Avoid deleting | `main`, `develop`, `release/*`, etc.    | These are long-lived branches             |

##### 8.4: Enabling auto-delete merged branches
Excellent plan! ✅ Enabling **auto-delete merged branches** is a great productivity boost — and yes, it’s **very safe** to use *if configured properly*.

Here’s how to **enable auto-delete for temporary branches only** (like `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `hotfix/*`) — while **protecting long-lived branches** like `main`, `develop`, and `release/*`.

---

## ✅ 1. Enable Auto-Delete Merged Branches

Go to your repo settings:

**GitHub UI →**
`Settings` → `General` → `Pull Requests` →
✔️ **Automatically delete head branches after pull requests are merged**

This will auto-delete the branch after a **successful PR merge**, **only** if:

* The branch was the source of the PR (head branch)
* It’s not protected (we’ll get to that)

---

## ✅ 2. Protect Long-Lived Branches (`main`, `develop`, `release/*`)

This is key 🔐

Go to:

**GitHub UI →**
`Settings` → `Branches` → `Branch protection rules` →
Click **"Add rule"**

Create rules for each long-lived branch:

### Example Rules to Add:

#### 🔒 Rule: Protect `main`

* Branch name pattern: `main`
* ✅ Require pull request before merging
* ✅ Prevent force pushes
* ✅ Prevent deletion

#### 🔒 Rule: Protect `develop`

* Branch name pattern: `develop`
* ✅ Same settings as above

#### 🔒 Rule: Protect all `release/*` branches

* Branch name pattern: `release/*`
* ✅ Same settings as above

> ❗ This protection rule will **block deletion**, even if auto-delete is enabled globally.

---

## ✅ Final Result

| Branch      | Auto-deleted after PR merge? | Protected? |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| `feature/*` | ✅ Yes                        | ❌ No       |
| `bugfix/*`  | ✅ Yes                        | ❌ No       |
| `hotfix/*`  | ✅ Yes                        | ❌ No       |
| `main`      | ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes      |
| `develop`   | ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes      |
| `release/*` | ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes      |

---

## 🧠 Extra Tips
* Don't enable auto-delete on shared team branches unless you protect them
* For bonus safety: turn on **"Require status checks"** in the protection rules (e.g. CI must pass before merge)

## 📊 Version Flow Summary

| Step | Branch Type | Example                   | Purpose                |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 2    | feature/\*  | feature/add-footer        | Add new functionality  |
| 3    | develop     | develop                   | Integrate features     |
| 3    | release/\*  | release/v1.0.0            | Prepare for release    |
| 4    | main        | main                      | Stable production code |
| 5    | hotfix/\*   | hotfix/fix-title          | Critical prod fix      |
| 6    | bugfix/\*   | bugfix/fix-footer-spacing | QA-only patch          |


 ## Branch Types: Temporary vs Permanent
| Branch Type | Examples               | Type          | Purpose                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `main`      | `main`                 | **Permanent** | Stable production-ready code                                             |
| `develop`   | `develop`              | **Permanent** | Ongoing integration of features                                          |
| `feature/*` | `feature/add-login`    | **Temporary** | New features (merged into `develop`)                                     |
| `release/*` | `release/v1.2.0`       | **Temporary** | Prepares a release (merged to `main`)                                    |
| `hotfix/*`  | `hotfix/fix-crash`     | **Temporary** | Emergency fixes (merged into `main` & `develop`)                         |
| `bugfix/*`  | `bugfix/fix-qa-footer` | **Temporary** | Non-critical fixes from a version tag (merged into `develop` or staging) |

**Permanent branches (long-lived):**
    main: Always exists, production code only
    develop: Always exists, for integrating features
    Temporary branches (short-lived, created as needed):
    feature/*: Deleted after merge into develop
    release/*: Deleted after merge into main
    hotfix/*: Deleted after merge into main and develop
    bugfix/*: Deleted after merge into develop or release

**Best Practice:**
    Treat hotfix/* and bugfix/* just like feature/*:
    Create → Work → PR → Merge → Delete
    Never push these branches to production permanently.
    Keep your repo clean by deleting them after use (PR merge).
