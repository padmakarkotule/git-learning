# GitHub Branching Strategy (Workflow for Multi-Repo) 
## Hands-on Lab (Beginner Friendly) for Multi-Repository only and not for Mono-Repository.

Learn GitHub Branching Strategy (workflow) step by step using a simple web page (`index.html`) 
and a `version.txt` file to track and deploy changes across environments.

---

## 🧰 Step 1: Setup Project

### 1.1 Create a GitHub Repository
- Go to **https://github.com**
- Click **"New"** → Create a repo named **`branching-strategy-lab`**
- Do **not** initialize with README or `.gitignore`

### 1.2 Clone the Repository

    ```bash
    # git clone https://github.com/padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git (Using https)
        **Using ssh**
    git clone git@github.com:padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git 
    cd branching-strategy-lab
    ```
### 1.3 Add Initial Files


#### Create index.html file. E.g. vi index.html 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Workflow Lab</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Hello from version <span id="version"></span></h1>
<script>
fetch('version.txt')
  .then(res => res.text())
  .then(version => document.getElementById('version').innerText = version);
</script>
</body>
</html>
```
    Save file with name index.html.

#### version.txt

```bash
echo "1.0.0" > version.txt
```

### 1.4 Commit and Push to Main

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with version 1.0.0"
git push origin main
```

---
##### Naming Recommendation for Branches and Tags
    | Purpose      | Recommended Name |
    | ------------ | ---------------- |
    | Main (prod)  | `main`           |
    | Development  | `develop`        |
    | Feature work | `feature/xyz`    |
    | Release prep | `release/vX.Y.Z` |
    | Hotfix       | `hotfix/issue`   |
    | Bugfix (QA)  | `bugfix/issue`   |

E.g.
Recommended Practice
Use:
 - Branch: hotfix/fix-login
 - Tag after merge: 1.0.1-hotfix
| Branch Type | Name               | Tag            |
| ----------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| hotfix      | `hotfix/fix-login` | `v1.0.1-hotfix` |
| bugfix      | `bugfix/css-issue` | `v1.0.2-bugfix` |
| release     | `release/v1.0.0`   | `v1.0.0`        |

- Tags are your canonical version markers (v1.0.1-hotfix)
- Branch names are for working context (hotfix/login-crash, bugfix/css-spacing)
- Keeping them separate but related is the cleanest approach

## 🚀 Step 2: Feature Development Workflow

### 2.1 Create `develop` Branch

```bash
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop
```
**Note** - When you use checkout -b develop, in this case all content from main are copied to develop brnach, 
         - So, no need to raise PR
         - You can use it later changes.
E.g.

```bash 
    $ git push origin develop
    Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    remote:
    remote: Create a pull request for 'develop' on GitHub by visiting:
    remote:      https://github.com/padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab/pull/new/develop
    remote:
    To github.com:padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git
    * [new branch]      develop -> develop
```
**Tips:**
-  Do you need a PR from main → develop at this point?
    - Since you created the develop branch after adding files to main, 
    - the develop branch was created from main at that moment, so the contents are identical right now.
    Not necessary, if:
    - You created develop directly from main (which you did), and
    - You haven’t made any additional changes in main after creating develop.
-  Best Practice Going Forward
    - All development starts from develop
    - Only release/* or hotfix/* branches should ever pull changes from main
    - Use PRs even for main → develop merges to keep process consistent.

### 2.2 Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-footer
```

### 2.3 Modify `index.html`

Add footer:

```html
<footer><p>Created by Padmakar Kotule</p></footer>
```

### 2.4 Commit and Push

```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add footer to index"
git push origin feature/add-footer
```

    This will show following output,
```bash
$ git push origin feature/add-footer
    Enumerating objects: 5, done.
    Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
    Delta compression using up to 8 threads
    Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 416 bytes | 208.00 KiB/s, done.
    Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.
    remote:
    remote: Create a pull request for 'feature/add-footer' on GitHub by visiting:
    remote:      https://github.com/padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab/pull/new/feature/add-footer
    remote:
    To github.com:padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git
    * [new branch]      feature/add-footer -> feature/add-footer
```

### 2.5 Raise Pull Request (PR) to `develop`

#### Steps to Raise PR on GitHub

1. Go to **[https://github.com/](https://github.com/)padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab**
2. You’ll see a banner: “Compare & pull request” → Click it
   *OR:* Click **"Pull requests"** → **"New pull request"**
3. Select:

   * **Base branch:** `develop`
   * **Compare branch:** `feature/add-footer`
4. Click **"Create pull request"**
5. Enter title & description (e.g. “Added footer section to index.html”)

6. After review, click **"Merge pull request"**
7. Then click **"Delete branch"** if prompted

### Sync your local develop branch with remote
-  Go to your develop branch
`git checkout develop`
- Go to your develop branch
`git pull origin develop`


---

## 📦 Step 3: Release Preparation

### 3.1 Bump Version in `develop`

```bash
git checkout develop
echo "1.0.1" >> version.txt
git add version.txt
git commit -m "Updated version to 1.0.1"
git push origin develop
```
## IMP - You Might Have Skipped PR in This Case and try to aviod this**
**Better Practice (With PR)**
## Suggested steps (Instead of given above):

# 1. Checkout a temporary branch for the version updates
git checkout -b version/update-1.0.1

# 2. Edit version.txt
echo "1.0.1" >> version.txt

# 3. Commit
git add version.txt
git commit -m "Update version to 1.0.1 for upcoming release"

# 4. Push
git push origin version/update-1.0.1

E.g. output
```bash
    $ git push origin version/update-1.0.1
    Enumerating objects: 5, done.
    Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
    Delta compression using up to 8 threads
    Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 292 bytes | 292.00 KiB/s, done.
    Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.
    remote:
    remote: Create a pull request for 'version/update-1.0.1' on GitHub by visiting:
    remote:      https://github.com/padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab/pull/new/version/update-1.0.1
    remote:
    To github.com:padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git
    * [new branch]      version/update-1.0.1 -> version/update-1.0.1
```
5. Create a Pull Request
    - Open GitHub
    - Compare: version/update-1.0.1 → develop
    - Add description: why you're updating the version
    - Submit for review
    - Merge once approved


### 3.2 Create Release Branch from `main`

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release/v1.0.1
git push origin release/v1.0.1

# output
$ git push origin release/v1.0.1
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote:
remote: Create a pull request for 'release/v1.0.1' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab/pull/new/release/v1.0.1
remote:
To github.com:padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git
 * [new branch]      release/v1.0.1 -> release/v1.0.1

```

### 3.3 Raise PR: `develop` → `release/v1.0.1`

#### PR Steps

1. Go to GitHub → "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
2. **Base branch**: `release/v1.0.1`
3. **Compare branch**: `develop`
4. Review, then click **"Create pull request"**
5. After review, click **"Merge pull request"**

**Note**
In this scenario, make sure that base branch is `release/v1.0.1` and Compare branch is `develop`.
This will show in GitHub UI too, as `data will copy from develop to release/v1.0.1`
E.g. In UI it will show as,
 `release/v1.0.1` (base branch) <--- `develop`(Compare branch)

---

## 🏷️ Step 4: Tag and Final Merge

### 4.1 Raise PR: `release/v1.0.1` → `main`

##### When to Use git tag

- Tag After Merge to main
- `**You should create the Git tag after the PR is merged from release/* to main.**`
Why ?
Reason                                     
- Tag = production-ready snapshot 
    (Once the release PR is merged into main, the commit on main is the one that’s been reviewed and approved. 
    This is what you want to tag and deploy.)         
- Clean history (Tagging before the merge can result in the tag pointing to a commit that’s not actually on main yet.) 
- CI/CD compatibility (Most CI/CD pipelines are triggered by tags on the main branch (e.g., on: push: tags:). )

###### **Typical Workflow Example**
        # Assume you're on release/v1.0.1 and it's ready
        # Create a PR: release/v1.0.1 → main

        # Once the PR is merged into main:
        git checkout main
        git pull origin main

        # Now tag the latest commit on main
        git tag -a 1.0.1 -m "Release version 1.0.1"
        git push origin 1.0.1

###### **Optional: Automate Tagging with CI and `IMP DevOps uses this in CI pipeline`**
#### PR Steps

1. Go to GitHub → "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
2. **Base**: `main`
3. **Compare**: `release/v0.2.0`
4. Review and click **"Create pull request"**
5. Merge when approved


### 4.2 Tag the Release
There are two options to use tag. 
1. lightweight tags and
2. Annotated Tags

E.g. of lightweight tag
```bash
git checkout main
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```

E.g. of Annotated tag

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Release version 1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1

# You can inspect your tag like this
git show v1.0.1

```

# Output of git push origin v1.0.1
    $ git push origin v1.0.1
    Enumerating objects: 1, done.
    Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (1/1), 175 bytes | 58.00 KiB/s, done.
    Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    To github.com:padmakarkotule/branching-strategy-lab.git
    * [new tag]         v1.0.1 -> v1.0.1

- This creates an annotated tag
    - Includes:
        - Author 
        - Date 
        - commit message (-m)
        - Optional GPG signature 
        - Stored as a full Git object
- Git Automatically Captures:
    | Metadata      | Source                                           |
    | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | **Author**    | From your Git config (`user.name`, `user.email`) |
    | **Date/Time** | The moment the tag is created                    |
    | **Message**   | From the `-m` flag                               |

### Example output of git show v1.0.1 command
```bash
    $ git show v1.0.1
    tag v1.0.1
    Tagger: Padmakar Kotule <padmakar.kotule@gmail.com>
    Date:   Tue May 27 13:28:40 2025 +0530

    Release version v1.0.1

    commit 06ffea819571f430525b4e412209853ff07c22e6 (HEAD -> main, tag: v1.0.1, origin/main)
    Merge: dab55b6 3502d30
    Author: Padmakar Kotule <padmakar.kotule@gmail.com>
    Date:   Tue May 27 13:20:26 2025 +0530

        Merge pull request #5 from padmakarkotule/release/v1.0.1

        Release/v1.0.1
```

**Preferred for releases and version control**
**Note** - Tag is pushed (manually or CI, and prefereed way is by using in CI by reading version.txt file)

## 🔥 Step 5: Hotfix (Production Urgent Fix)

### 5.1 Create Hotfix Branch from `main`

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-title
```

### 5.2 Fix HTML Title

Update `index.html`:

<title>Workflow Lab - Hotfix</title>
```

### 5.3 Update `version.txt`

```bash
echo "1.0.1-hotfix" > version.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Hotfix: Update title"
git push origin hotfix/fix-title
```

### 5.4 Raise PR: `hotfix/fix-title` → `main`

#### PR Steps

1. GitHub → "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
2. **Base**: `main`, **Compare**: `hotfix/fix-title`
3. Create and merge PR

### 5.5 Tag the Hotfix

```bash
git tag 1.0.1-hotfix
git push origin 1.0.1-hotfix
```

### 5.6 Sync Fix with `develop`

Raise PR: `main` → `develop`

#### PR Steps

1. GitHub → "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
2. **Base**: `develop`, **Compare**: `main`
3. Create and merge PR to keep `develop` up to date

---

## Step 6: Bugfix (QA/Staging Patch)

### 6.1 Create Bugfix from Tagged Release

```bash
git fetch --tags
git checkout tags/1.0.1 -b bugfix/fix-footer-spacing
```

### 6.2 Apply Bug Fix in HTML

Fix CSS/footer spacing or logic in `index.html`.

### 6.3 Update Version

```bash
echo "1.0.1-bugfix" > version.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Bugfix: Footer spacing"
git push origin bugfix/fix-footer-spacing
```

### 6.4 Raise PR to `develop` or `release/v0.2.1`

#### PR Steps

1. Go to GitHub → Pull Requests → "New pull request"
2. **Base**: `develop` (or `release/v1.0.1`)
3. **Compare**: `bugfix/fix-footer-spacing`
4. Create and merge PR

### 6.5 Optional: Tag Bugfix

```bash
git tag 1.0.1-bugfix
git push origin 1.0.1-bugfix
```

---

## 🌐 Step 7: Test Version in Browser

When running locally or deployed (via GitHub Pages or any server), you should see:

```plaintext
Hello from version 1.0.1
```

✅ Confirms which version is live by reading `version.txt`.

---

## 🧼 Step 8: Cleanup Merged Branches

```bash
git branch -d bugfix/fix-footer-spacing
git push origin --delete bugfix/fix-footer-spacing
```

---

## 📊 Version Flow Summary

| Step | Branch Type | Example                   | Purpose                |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 2    | feature/\*  | feature/add-footer        | Add new functionality  |
| 3    | develop     | develop                   | Integrate features     |
| 3    | release/\*  | release/v0.2.0            | Prepare for release    |
| 4    | main        | main                      | Stable production code |
| 5    | hotfix/\*   | hotfix/fix-title          | Critical prod fix      |
| 6    | bugfix/\*   | bugfix/fix-footer-spacing | QA-only patch          |


 ## Branch Types: Temporary vs Permanent
| Branch Type | Examples               | Type          | Purpose                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `main`      | `main`                 | **Permanent** | Stable production-ready code                                             |
| `develop`   | `develop`              | **Permanent** | Ongoing integration of features                                          |
| `feature/*` | `feature/add-login`    | **Temporary** | New features (merged into `develop`)                                     |
| `release/*` | `release/v1.2.0`       | **Temporary** | Prepares a release (merged to `main`)                                    |
| `hotfix/*`  | `hotfix/fix-crash`     | **Temporary** | Emergency fixes (merged into `main` & `develop`)                         |
| `bugfix/*`  | `bugfix/fix-qa-footer` | **Temporary** | Non-critical fixes from a version tag (merged into `develop` or staging) |

**Permanent branches (long-lived):**
    main: Always exists, production code only
    develop: Always exists, for integrating features
    Temporary branches (short-lived, created as needed):
    feature/*: Deleted after merge into develop
    release/*: Deleted after merge into main
    hotfix/*: Deleted after merge into main and develop
    bugfix/*: Deleted after merge into develop or release

**Best Practice:**
    Treat hotfix/* and bugfix/* just like feature/*:
    Create → Work → PR → Merge → Delete
    Never push these branches to production permanently.
    Keep your repo clean by deleting them after use (PR merge).
    Would you like this included in your lab guide too as a “Best Practices” or FAQ section?

## Best Practices Recap

* Always raise PRs to merge changes
* Bump `version.txt` before tagging
* Use clear tags like `0.2.1-hotfix`, `0.2.1-bugfix`
* Never commit directly to `main`
* Tag from `release/*`, `hotfix/*`, `bugfix/*` only
* Delete merged branches to keep repo clean
