Absolutely — adding a **`hotfix/*` workflow** is a great enhancement, especially for production emergencies. It ensures that:

* 🔧 Fixes go live quickly via `main`
* 🔁 Fixes are also synced back to `develop` so they aren’t lost in future releases

Let me update the complete team-ready GitHub workflow to include the **hotfix process**.

## 🗂️ Branch Structure

| Branch      | Purpose                     | Who Works On It  |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `main`      | Production-ready code       | Release managers |
| `develop`   | Integration of all features | All developers   |
| `feature/*` | Individual feature branches | Developers       |
| `release/*` | Pre-release QA & tagging    | QA/Leads         |
| `hotfix/*`  | Urgent fixes for production | Leads/Devs       |

## ✅ Step-by-Step Workflows

---

### 👨‍💻 Feature Development

1. **Create from `develop`**:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b feature/login-form
   ```
2. **Work, commit, and push**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/login-form
   ```
3. **Open PR: `feature/login-form` → `develop`**

---

### 🚀 Release Preparation

1. **Update version.txt in `develop`**:

   ```bash
   echo "1.0.2" > version.txt
   git add version.txt
   git commit -m "Bump version to 1.0.2"
   git push origin develop
   ```

2. **Create `release/v1.0.2` from `main`**:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b release/v1.0.2
   git push origin release/v1.0.2
   ```

3. **Open PR: `develop` → `release/v1.0.2`**

4. **After merge**, tag the release:

   ```bash
   git tag 1.0.2
   git push origin 1.0.2
   ```

5. **Open PR: `release/v1.0.2` → `main`**

---

### 🔥 Hotfix Process

#### Scenario: A bug is found in production after release `1.0.2`.

---

#### 1. **Create a Hotfix Branch from `main`**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix
```

---

#### 2. **Fix the bug and bump version**

```bash
# Make code changes
echo "1.0.3" > version.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Hotfix: urgent bug fix for 1.0.3"
git push origin hotfix/urgent-fix
```

---

#### 3. **Open PR: `hotfix/urgent-fix` → `main`**

* Get approval
* Run tests
* Tag after merge:

```bash
git tag 1.0.3
git push origin 1.0.3
```

---

#### 4. **Sync Fix to `develop`**

After merging the hotfix into `main`, open a second PR:

🔁 **PR: `main` → `develop`**

> This ensures the hotfix is included in the next release branch.

```

## ✅ Best Practices Recap

* Use **feature branches** off `develop`
* Use **release branches** from `main`
* Use **hotfix branches** from `main` for emergencies
* All merges must go via **Pull Requests**
* Use **version.txt** and **tags** for traceability
* Tag **only from release or hotfix branches**
* Sync hotfixes back to `develop` to avoid regression
