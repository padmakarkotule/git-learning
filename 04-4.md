# 🚀 GitHub Workflow Guide: Branching, PRs, Versioning, and Tagging

---

## 🔧 Purpose

This guide defines a standardized Git workflow for developers, QA, and release managers, with:

* Structured **branching strategy**
* Mandatory **Pull Requests (PRs)**
* Version control using **`version.txt`**
* **Git tags** for release tracking
* Enforced **branch protection rules**

---

## 🗂️ Branch Structure

| Branch      | Purpose                     | Who Works On It  |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `main`      | Production-ready code       | Release managers |
| `develop`   | Integration of all features | All developers   |
| `feature/*` | Individual feature branches | Developers       |
| `release/*` | Pre-release QA & tagging    | QA/Leads         |

---

## 🧭 End-to-End Workflow

```plaintext
feature/* → develop → release/* → main
```

---

### ✅ Step 1: Create a Feature

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/login-form
# Work on code
git add .
git commit -m "Add login form"
git push origin feature/login-form
```

🔁 **Open PR: `feature/login-form` → `develop`**

* Code review required
* CI must pass
* Merge after approval

---

### ✅ Step 2: Prepare a Release

1. **Update `version.txt` in `develop`**:

```bash
echo "1.0.2" > version.txt
git add version.txt
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.0.2"
git push origin develop
```

2. **Create `release/v1.0.2` from `main`**:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release/v1.0.2
git push origin release/v1.0.2
```

3. 🔁 **Open PR: `develop` → `release/v1.0.2`**

* Brings new changes into the release branch
* Reviewed & tested by QA
* Final version confirmed

---

### ✅ Step 3: Tag the Release

Once the `develop` → `release` PR is merged:

```bash
git checkout release/v1.0.2
git pull origin release/v1.0.2
git tag 1.0.2
git push origin 1.0.2
```

📦 This creates a permanent tag on the commit for version `1.0.2`.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Final Merge into `main`

🔁 **Open PR: `release/v1.0.2` → `main`**

* Final sign-off
* CI checks must pass
* Only leads/release managers can approve

✅ Once merged, production is up to date with version `1.0.2`.

## 🔒 Branch Protection Rules (GitHub Settings)

| Branch      | Rule                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main`      | ✅ Require PRs, ✅ Require CI checks, ✅ Restrict merges to release/\* |
| `release/*` | ✅ Require PRs from `develop`, ✅ Status checks, ✅ Approvals          |
| `develop`   | ✅ Require PRs from `feature/*`, ✅ CI, ✅ Reviewers                   |

---

## 🧾 CODEOWNERS (in `.github/CODEOWNERS`)

```plaintext
# Require specific reviewers for critical branches
/main @release-managers
/release/* @qa-team @release-managers
/develop @dev-leads
```

---

## 🧪 CI Validation: Tag Must Match version.txt

Optional GitHub Action to verify that the pushed tag matches the version in `version.txt`:

```yaml
name: Validate Tag Matches Version
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  check-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Compare tag to version.txt
        run: |
          TAG="${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/}"
          VERSION=$(cat version.txt)
          if [[ "$TAG" != "$VERSION" ]]; then
            echo "❌ Tag '$TAG' does not match version.txt '$VERSION'"
            exit 1
          fi
```

## ✅ Summary Diagram

```plaintext
feature/login-form
     ↑
     |  [PR to develop]
     ↓
   develop ──[PR to release/v1.0.2]──→ release/v1.0.2 ──[PR to main]──→ main
                             ↑                                ↑
          version.txt = 1.0.2 and tag 1.0.2             Protected branch
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* 🔁 Always use PRs for all merges.
* ✍️ Bump `version.txt` in `develop` before tagging.
* 🏷️ Tag releases from `release/*` branches only.
* 🔒 Protect `main` and `release/*` from direct pushes.
